# Mini Python Compiler ( if - else and while loop )
  A Mini Compiler is Built for Python and handles the If-Elif-Else and the While Constructs using c programming language. Lex and Flex are tools for generating scanners:
programs which recognize lexical patterns in text. Flex is a faster version of Lex. Lex/Flex refers to either of the tools. Yacc and Bison are tools for generating parsers: programs which recognize the grammatical structure of programs. Bison is a faster version of Yacc.

Steps to run :
1.	Go to the directory which contains "makefile"
2.	Run the command "make"
3.	Run the command "./Test.out < input1.py" , where "input1.py" is any python file.
