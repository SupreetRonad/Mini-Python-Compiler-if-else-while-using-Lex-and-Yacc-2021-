A Mini Compiler is Built for Python and handles the If-Elif-Else and the While
Constructs using c programming language. Lex and Flex are tools for generating scanners:
programs which recognize lexical patterns in text. Flex is a faster version of Lex. Lex/Flex
refers to either of the tools. Yacc and Bison are tools for generating parsers: programs which
recognize the grammatical structure of programs. Bison is a faster version of Yacc.
The optimizer applies semantics preserving transformations to the annotated parse
tree to simplify the structure of the tree and to facilitate the generation of more efficient code.
The code generator transforms the simplified annotated parse tree into object code using rules
which denote the semantics of the source language. The code generator may be integrated
with the parser.
